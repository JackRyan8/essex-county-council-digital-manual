# {{ page.title }}

Use buttons to help users carry out an action.

<a class="button button-start" href="financial-assessment-eligibility" role="button">Start application</a>

    <a class="button button-start" href="financial-assessment-eligibility" role="button">Start application</a>

<input type="submit" class="button" value="Continue">

    <input type="submit" class="button" value="Continue">

## When to use buttons

Buttons should be used to help users carry out a task, like starting an application.

Buttons should be used to:
<ul>
  <li>Start a form</li>
  <li>Continue to the next question of a form</li>
  <li>Subscribe to something, such as email notifications</li>
</ul>

## When not to use buttons

Buttons shouldn’t be used to replace links within the body of a page.

## How to use buttons

Button text should be written in sentence case and clearly tell the user what the action is. For example, ‘Start now’, ‘Continue’, ‘Subscribe’.

Having mulitple buttons on a page can confuse a user. GOV.UK recommends having one thing per page.
