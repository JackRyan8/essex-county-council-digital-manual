# {{ page.title }}

Lists should be used to break up chunks of text to make it easier to read.

There are 3 types of list that can be used:

- [Unordered/Bulleted List](#unordered-list)
- [Ordered/Numbered List](#ordered-list)
- [Description List]()

## Unordered list

Introduce unordered lists with a lead-in line ending with a colon for context. Do not use full stops at the end of the item.

<ul>
  <li>Short term (up to 6 weeks)</li>
  <li>Aids and minor adaptations</li>
  <li>Support services offered to carers</li>
</ul>

      <li>Short term (up to 6 weeks)</li>
      <li>Aids and minor adaptations</li>
      <li>Support services offered to carers</li>
    </ul>

## Ordered list

Use ordered lists when the order of the items is relevant.

Items should be complete sentences and end in a full stop.

<ol>
  <li>Paying for care and support</li>
  <li>Care in a residential home</li>
  <li>Financial assessment explained</li>
</ol>
