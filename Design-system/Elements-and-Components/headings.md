Page headings are used to define areas of content

<h1 class="page-heading">Page heading</h1>

    <h1 class="page-heading">Page heading</h1>

<h2 class="content-heading">Content heading</h2>

    <h2 class="content-heading">Content heading</h2>

<h3 class="section-heading">Section heading</h3>

    <h3 class="section-heading">Section heading</h3>

<h4 class="sub-section-heading">Sub-section heading</h4>

    <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Sub-section heading</h4>


## When to use a heading

Headings should be written in sentence case and follow correct semantic structure, for example h1 before h2.

Page heading is styled as h1 and should only be used to display the title of the page. Every page should have a unique page heading but it shouldnâ€™t appear more than once on a page.

* Page heading is used at the top of each page.
* Content heading is used for each new and unlreated piece of content within a page.
* Section heading is used for each section within content on a page.
* Sub-section heading is used for those occasional cases where you need to break a content section down further or for certain preview sections.
