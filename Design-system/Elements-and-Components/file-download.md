Use file download links for displaying to users downloadable files such as pdf's.

<div class="file-download"><a href="/public/images/test-pdf-file.pdf" class="file-link">This is a title for the file download link</a>
	<p><span>PDF, 4.84 MB</span>This is used for any descriptions required for this downloadable file.</p>

If we need to show multiple files it is recommended to have signposting, this identifies to impaired users that all documents may not be accessible.

<div class="file-collection">
	<h4>Related information</h4>

## When to use file download

All content should be in the form of HTML (Web pages). If there is a clear need to have a seperate document for users, use the file download to allow users to download extra content about a subject matter.
