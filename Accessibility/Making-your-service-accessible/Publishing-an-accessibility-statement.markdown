# {{ page.title }}

All public sectors websites need to meet [accessibility standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement) and the regulations require you to publish an accessibility statement on your website. 

An accessibility statement:  

- explains the level of accessibility across the website or app 
- shows where there are barriers 
- gives alternative ways for a user to access information 
- enables users to contact the website owner if they find issues 
 

## Writing a statement 
 

When you’re writing an accessibility statement, include: 

- any inaccessible parts of the website or app 
- how people with different needs can access content that isn’t accessible 
- contact details so people can report accessibility issues 
- information on the enforcement procedure if people are not happy with the response 

The statement needs to be updated regularly. For example, when accessibility issues have been fixed, or when new ones have been found. 

The Government Digital Services (GDS) has produced a [sample accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website). It includes sample wording, guidance on what to include in your statement and where to publish it. 

The [accessibility statement on essex.gov.uk](https://www.essex.gov.uk/accessibility) is a good example of what a published accessibility statement looks like.
