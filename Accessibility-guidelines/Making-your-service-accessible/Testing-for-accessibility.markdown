# {{ page.title }}

Testing your service is an important step in meeting the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag#wcag-20-design-principles). 

Test during development and check for accessibility issues regularly once it’s gone live.  
 

## Automated testing 

Automated testing tools are a useful way of checking to see if your service is accessible. They are quick to run, provide instant feedback and can be used across lots of pages. 

There are different automated testing tools available like [Siteimprove](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc), [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and [Wave](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/). Some are free to use and can be accessed online. 

Automated tools only pick up around 30% of accessibility issues, so it’s important to use manual testing to identify issues that have been missed. 


## Manual testing 
 

Manual testing finds accessibility issues that automated testing has missed.  
 
These include:  

- keyboard-only navigation 
- link text that isn’t descriptive (for example, ‘click here’ links) 
- lack of colour contrast 
- missing alt text 
- online forms that aren’t marked up correctly  

You can use the handy accessibility checklist from 18F to complete a manual test for your service.
