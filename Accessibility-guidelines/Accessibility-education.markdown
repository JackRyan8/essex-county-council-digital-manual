## Why is it important

### Legal obligation

Equalities act 2010: 
“provision of a service to the public or a section of the public (for payment or not) must not discriminate against a person requiring the service by not providing the person with the service.”

Public sector bodies regulations 2018:
These regulations mean we have a responsibility to make sure our digital services (made up of websites, apps, forms and online dosuments) are accessible to everyone. 

### Financial Benefit

Channel shift directs customers towards online channels instead of using more conventional ones such as face to face or via telephone. Inaccessible online channels will force customers to revert back to more epensive channels. 

### It helps make products robust

When building tools and services to be accessible, we also make them robust. The benfits of making something accesible to someone with a visual impairment that is a keyboard only users could also benefit another individual. This could be a user that has an arm injury that cannot use a mouse or a new mother who is carrying their newborn child.

### It is the right thing to do

It is estimated that 1 in every 5 people have an impairment. Creating a service or online tool that is not accessible will exclude those people.  

## How to get started

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
