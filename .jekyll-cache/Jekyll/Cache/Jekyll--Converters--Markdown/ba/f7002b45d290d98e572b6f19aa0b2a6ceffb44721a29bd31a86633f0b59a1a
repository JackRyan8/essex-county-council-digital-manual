<p>Testing your service is an important step in meeting the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag#wcag-20-design-principles">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAGâ€¯2.1)</a>.</p>

<p>Test during development and check for accessibility issues regularly once itâ€™s gone live.</p>

<h2 id="automated-testing">Automated testing</h2>

<p>Automated testing tools are a useful way of checking to see if your service is accessible. They are quick to run, provide instant feedback and can be used across lots of pages.</p>

<p>There are different automated testing tools available like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc">Siteimprove</a>, <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">aXe</a> and <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/extension/">Wave</a>. Some are free to use and can be accessed online.</p>

<p>Automated tools only pick up around 30% of accessibility issues, so itâ€™s important to use manual testing to identify issues that have been missed.</p>

<h2 id="manual-testing">Manual testing</h2>

<p>Manual testing finds accessibility issues that automated testing has missed.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keyboard-only navigation</li>
  <li>link text that isnâ€™t descriptive (for example, â€˜click hereâ€™ links)</li>
  <li>lack of colour contrast</li>
  <li>missing alt text</li>
  <li>online forms that arenâ€™t marked up correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the handy accessibility checklist from 18F to complete a manual test for your service.</p>
