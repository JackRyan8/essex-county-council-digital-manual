<h2 id="using-insets">Using insets</h2>

<p>An inset is a visual aid to differentiate an excerpt of text from the body of content. It should contain information thatâ€™s useful or important to the user.</p>

<div class="inset">
  <p>
  	It can be embedded anywhere within the body content of a page.
  </p>
</div>

<p>It shouldnâ€™t be used instead of an <a href="/docs/core/components/alert">alert</a> which should provide very important information for a limited time. This could be both service or system alerts.</p>

<p>** Note: ** * the Stockport codebase uses the term Alert Inline for what we call Inset. *</p>
