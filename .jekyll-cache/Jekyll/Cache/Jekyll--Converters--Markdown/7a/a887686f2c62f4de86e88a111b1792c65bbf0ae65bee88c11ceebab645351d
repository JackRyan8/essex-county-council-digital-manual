<p>All public sectors websites need to meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement">accessibility standards</a> and the regulations require you to publish an accessibility statement on your website.</p>

<p>An accessibility statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explains the level of accessibility across the website or app</li>
  <li>shows where there are barriers</li>
  <li>gives alternative ways for a user to access information</li>
  <li>enables users to contact the website owner if they find issues</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-a-statement">Writing a statement</h2>

<p>When youâ€™re writing an accessibility statement, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any inaccessible parts of the website or app</li>
  <li>how people with different needs can access content that isnâ€™t accessible</li>
  <li>contact details so people can report accessibility issues</li>
  <li>information on the enforcement procedure if people are not happy with the response</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement needs to be updated regularly. For example, when accessibility issues have been fixed, or when new ones have been found.</p>

<p>The Government Digital Services (GDS) has produced a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">sample accessibility statement</a>. It includes sample wording, guidance on what to include in your statement and where to publish it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/accessibility">accessibility statement on essex.gov.uk</a> is a good example of what a published accessibility statement looks like.</p>
