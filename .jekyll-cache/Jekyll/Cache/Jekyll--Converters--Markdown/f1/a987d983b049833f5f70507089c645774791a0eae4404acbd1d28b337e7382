<p>The GDS’s Service Standard provides the principles of building a good service. This manual explains what teams can do to build great services that will meet the standard. (Rewording required)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand users and their needs</li>
</ol>

<p>Develop a deep understanding of users and the problem you’re trying to solve for them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Solve a whole problem for users
Work towards creating a service that solves one whole problem for users, collaborating across organisational boundaries where necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a joined-up experience across all channels
Work towards creating a service that meets users’ needs across all channels, including online, phone, paper and face to face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make the service simple to use 
Build a service that’s simple, intuitive and comprehensible. And test it with users to make sure it works for them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure everyone can use the service 
Provide a service that everyone can use, including people with disabilities or other legally protected characteristics. And people who don’t have access to the internet or lack the skills or confidence to use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a multidisciplinary team 
Put in place a multidisciplinary team that can create and operate the service in a sustainable way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use agile ways of working 
Create the service using agile, iterative user-centred methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iterate and improve frequently 
Make sure you have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to iterate and improve the service frequently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a secure service which protects users’ privacy 
Evaluate what data the service will be collecting, storing and providing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define what success looks like and publish performance data 
Work out what success looks like for your service and identify metrics which will tell you what’s working and what can be improved, combined with user research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose the right tools and technology 
Choose tools and technology that let you create a high quality service in a cost effective way. Minimise the cost of changing direction in future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make new source code open 
Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences. Or if this isn’t possible, provide a convincing explanation of why this can’t be done for specific subsets of the source code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns 
Build on open standards and common components and patterns from inside and outside government.</p>
  </li>
