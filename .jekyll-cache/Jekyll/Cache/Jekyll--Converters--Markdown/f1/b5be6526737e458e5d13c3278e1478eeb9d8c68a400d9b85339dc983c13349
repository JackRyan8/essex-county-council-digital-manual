<h2 id="using-panel">Using panel</h2>

<p>A panel is used when showing additional information within forms based on what is selected by the user.</p>

<p>This has a visual simialrty to <a href="inset">Inset</a>, but with no background colour.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s debatable if Inset and Panel can be combined for the future.</p>
