<p>Before planning your content project, you need to consider if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s a valid <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Service-Transformation-team/User-need">user need</a>? who content is for and why they need it</li>
  <li>it’s Essex County Council’s (ECC’s) job to publish the content?</li>
  <li>the information, advice or guidance is available elsewhere? are you duplicating content?</li>
  <li>essex.gov.uk is the best platform to use? could it be a social media post or a blog?</li>
</ul>

<p>Go ahead with the project if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s a clear user need</li>
  <li>it’s ECC’s statutory obligation to publish it</li>
  <li>it’s an ECC service</li>
  <li>You must have evidence to back the user needs. This could be from Google Analytics data or user feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t go ahead with the project if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there isn’t a valid user need</li>
  <li>it’s already published elsewhere, like NHS or GOV.UK</li>
  <li>it’s not ECC’s job to publish it</li>
</ul>
