<p>An example for a Blue Badge application would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>As a</strong> person with a mobility problem</li>
  <li><strong>I want to</strong> apply for a Blue Badge permit</li>
  <li><strong>So that</strong> I can park directly outside my house and and the shops</li>
</ul>

<p>To demonstrate that you have delivered the right content to meet the user need you would develop a set of acceptance criteria which would include the user being able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find the application online</li>
  <li>understand the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>know what the permit does and doesnâ€™t entitle them to</li>
  <li>know what documentation they need to support their application</li>
  <li>know the format the documentation needs to be in i.e. scan, original and how/where to send it</li>
  <li>know how long the process takes</li>
</ul>

<p>You would test this with a sample of real users using your content.</p>
