<p>The user groups that we need to engage with vary depending on the products that we’re delivering.</p>

<h2 id="young-essex-assembly">Young Essex Assembly</h2>

<h2 id="identify-your-user-group">Identify your user group</h2>

<p>It’s important to identify your user group early on.</p>

<p>You can play back your user stories and confirm that they’re right, or highlight the gaps. You can show them early designs or prototypes and get their feedback.</p>

<p>Users might be part of an existing user group or forum.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask services if they have them or can put you in touch with users</li>
  <li>Ask the Insight and Intelligence Team if they have user groups</li>
  <li>There may be a partner organisation such as Age UK that can help</li>
</ul>
