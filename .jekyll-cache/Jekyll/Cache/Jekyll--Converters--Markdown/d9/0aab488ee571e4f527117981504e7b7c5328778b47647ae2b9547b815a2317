<p>User research is a valuable stage in any design approach. It helps you to understand if the idea works to solve the problems you found in the journey.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve mapped a front stage and back stage journey, which means you need to consider multiple users. This includes staff who are integral to the journey being successful, as well as the end users who require the service.</p>

<p>User testing at this stage is around quality and not quantity. Do enough testing until you hear recurring themes.</p>

<p>User testing of a prototype can take multiple forms, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interviews working through paper prototypes</li>
  <li>role play working through scenarios</li>
  <li>observations of userâ€™s behaviour working through a new journey</li>
</ul>
