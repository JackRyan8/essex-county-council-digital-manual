<h2 id="think-about-accessibility-for-the-start">Think about accessibility for the start</h2>

<p>Before you design and build a service, think about who might use it and how they will access it.</p>

<p>You should only create something if there is a <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Service-Transformation-team/User-need">user need</a> for it.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK Service Manual has detailed guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#what-to-do-about-accessibility-in-discovery">how to make your service accessible</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a clear user need for a new website, read the <a href="">guidance on buying a digital product or service</a>.</p>

<p>This will make sure that you’ve thought about accessibility before anything has been built.</p>

<h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities-for-accessibility">Roles and responsibilities for accessibility</h2>

<p>Find out what <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Placeholder-page">each role does in a service team to make sure content is accessible to everyone</a>.</p>

<h2 id="test-your-service-with-users">Test your service with users</h2>

<p>When you are doing research, you need to include users who have disabilities or use assistive technologies. The GOV.UK Service Manual has guidance on <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Placeholder-page">running research sessions with people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<h2 id="carry-out-automated-and-manual-testing">Carry out automated and manual testing</h2>

<p>Test your website regularly with automated and manual testing. It’s important to use both methods as automated testing alone will only pick up 30% of accessibility issues. Find out more about <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Accessibility/Making-your-service-accessible/Testing-for-accessibility">testing for accessibility</a>.</p>

<h2 id="publish-an-accessibility-statement">Publish an accessibility statement</h2>

<p>Once you’ve finished researching and testing your service, you need to write an accessibility statement. This is an important step as it’s part of the requirements of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">accessibility regulations</a>.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Accessibility/Making-your-service-accessible/Publishing-an-accessibility-statement">publishing an accessibility statement</a>.</p>

<h2 id="test-regularly">Test regularly</h2>

<p>Once your service is live, it’s important to carry on testing and researching.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check any new features you add meet accessibility regulations</li>
  <li>continue testing the service with users with disabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Review your accessibility statement at least once a year and update it if there are any changes that affect the accessibility of your site.</p>

<h2 id="offline-services">Offline services</h2>

<p>Think about other ways users will interact with your service.</p>

<p>Users who are deaf or have a speech impairment should have an alternative way to contact you. This could be by text, email or visiting in person with a <a href="https://intranet.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Translation_and_interpreting.aspx">British Sign Language translator or lip reader</a>.</p>

<p>If you send letters out, write them in <a href="/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Content-standards/Content-guidelines/Designing-content">plain English</a> and provide these in alternative accessible formats (EasyRead, large print or Braille).</p>

<p><a href="https://intranet.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Inclusive_Communication_Essex.aspx">Inclusive Communication Essex</a> can supply EasyRead documents and <a href="https://intranet.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Alternative_formats.aspx">Paragon Print</a> can supply other alternative formats.</p>
