<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you write and design your content, make sure you read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">Government Digital Service Style guide</a></p>

<h2 id="content-types">Content types</h2>

<p>You need to think about which content type best meets the user need.</p>

<p>You also need to consider the journey the user takes to get to your content. Make sure it is logical and consistent.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-pdfs">Avoid PDFs</h2>

<p>Content should be web pages (HTML) rather than PDFs as they arenâ€™t accessible.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-with-pdfs">The problem with PDFâ€™s</h3>

<p>PDFs are not the best solution because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assistive technologies such as screen readers find it much easier to read content on a webpage</li>
  <li>the content canâ€™t be searched by Google or the website search</li>
  <li>they are not designed to be read on mobile devices</li>
  <li>they can quickly become out of date with broken links</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-use-a-pdf">When to use a PDF</h3>

<p>PDFs should only be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there is a clear user need, with evidence to support it</li>
  <li>when there is a legal requirement to have a formal document</li>
  <li>a specific audience that need a special format, like an Easy Read document</li>
</ul>

<p>The legislation says that if you create a new PDF it must be fully accessible. Use the guidance on <a href="">creating an accessible PDF</a> to help you.</p>

<p>PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are exempt from the 23 September 2020 deadline, unless users need them in order to use a service.</p>

<p>Old PDFs should be replaced with a HTML web page or deleted if they are not needed.</p>
