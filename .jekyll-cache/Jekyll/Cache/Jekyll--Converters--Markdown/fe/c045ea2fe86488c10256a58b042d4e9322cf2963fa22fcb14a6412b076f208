<h1 id="manage-your-content">Manage your content</h1>

<p>After you publish content, you need to check if your content is still meeting user needs and expectations.</p>

<p>You can use data, user feedback and user research to keep improving your service. It’s a cycle of continuous improvement and iteration.</p>

<h2 id="understand-how-people-use-your-content">Understand how people use your content</h2>

<p>You need to understand how people are using your content.</p>

<p><a href="google-analytics-basics">Google Analytics reports</a> can tell you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which pages people are going to</li>
  <li>where they are coming from</li>
  <li>what they do while on the page</li>
  <li>where they go to afterwards</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this date to inform any changes to your content and improve the user journey.</p>

<h2 id="keep-content-accurate">Keep content accurate</h2>

<p>You need to make sure your content is accurate, consistent and up to date.</p>

<p>You should set review dates to check and maintain content. This should be an ongoing<br />
process to make sure your content is always up to date.</p>

<h2 id="do-ongoing-research">Do ongoing research</h2>

<p>User research shouldn’t stop after you publish your content.</p>

<p>You should do <a href="contents" title="User need and user behaviour">ongoing research</a> to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your users needs</li>
  <li>how they interact with your content</li>
  <li>if the user journey is logical</li>
</ul>

<p>User needs change over time so it’s important to do ongoing research to make sure you’re iterating content to meet these needs.</p>
