<h2 id="url">URL</h2>

<p>URLs should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be simple, clear and easy to read</li>
  <li>use lower case letters only</li>
  <li>use dashes to separate words</li>
  <li>be SEO friendly - this means they should contain keywords so they rank highly in search engines</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/url-standards-for-gov-uk">URL standards for GOV.UK</a> for more guidance on best practice URLs.</p>

<p>Examples of good URLs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge">www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge</a></li>
  <li><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/register-a-birth">www.essex.gov.uk/register-a-birth</a></li>
  <li><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/emergency-school-closures">www.essex.gov.uk/emergency-school-closures</a></li>
</ul>

<p>URLs should not contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capital letters</li>
  <li>dates</li>
  <li>acronyms where possible</li>
  <li>underscores to separate words</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of bad URLs are:</p>

<p><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/ICS">www.essex.gov.uk/ICS</a> - acronyms are unlikely to be SEO friendly or understood by users.</p>

<p><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/Annual-Report-2014">www.essex.gov.uk/Annual-Report-2014</a> - dates and time-limit the use of URLs. A better approach would be to use <a href="www.essex.gov.uk/annual-report">www.essex.gov.uk/annual-report</a> so the URL can continue to be used for subsequent years.</p>

<p><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/TLC_PROVIDERS">www.essex.gov.uk/TLC_PROVIDERS</a> - capital letters and underscores make URLs hard to read.</p>

<h2 id="short-urls">Short URLs</h2>

<h3 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h3>

<p>Short URLs, also known as vanity URLs, are unique, short links that redirect users to a web page that has a longer URL. For example:</p>

<p><a href="www.essex.gov.uk/cycling">www.essex.gov.uk/cycling</a> is a short URL that redirects users to <a href="http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Cycling.aspx">http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Cycling.aspx</a></p>

<h3 id="when-to-use-a-short-url">When to use a short URL</h3>

<p>Short URLs should be used for marketing purposes such as campaigns that require a unique campaign identity or have a need for users to remember a web link. They are often used on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>printed material like posters or leaflets</li>
  <li>videos</li>
  <li>audio (such as radio, podcasts or an automated contact centre message)</li>
</ul>

<p>They should be clear and easy for people to remember.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-short-url">When not to use a short URL</h3>

<p>Short URLs shouldnâ€™t be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the majority of URLs - there must be a marketing purpose</li>
  <li>instances where the original URL is already fit for purpose, for example <a href="www.essex.gov.uk/dementia">www.essex.gov.uk/dementia</a> is the original page URL</li>
  <li>external websites that are not owned by Essex County Council</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-short-urls">Creating short URLs</h3>

<p>Short URLs should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be simple, clear and easy to read</li>
  <li>make sense and be easy to remember</li>
  <li>use lower case only</li>
  <li>not use dashes or underscores â€“ try to use one word but if you need to use 2, they should be joined, for example <a href="www.essex.gov.uk/energyswitch">www.essex.gov.uk/energyswitch</a></li>
  <li>have an expiry date</li>
  <li>have a campaign tracking code</li>
  <li>have an owner who can confirm when the short URL is no longer in use</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="redirects">Redirects</h2>

<h3 id="what-are-they-1">What are they?</h3>

<p>A redirect sends users and search engines to a different URL from the one originally requested.</p>

<p>They are used to prevent broken links.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-use-a-redirect">When to use a redirect</h3>

<p>Redirects should be used when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>content is unpublished or archived</li>
  <li>URLs are changed â€“ this could be due to a significant change in page title or for SEO reasons</li>
  <li>content is moved to a new location, impacting the URL</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-redirects">When not to use redirects</h3>

<p>Redirects should not be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frequently</li>
  <li>for marketing purposes - see short URLs</li>
</ul>
