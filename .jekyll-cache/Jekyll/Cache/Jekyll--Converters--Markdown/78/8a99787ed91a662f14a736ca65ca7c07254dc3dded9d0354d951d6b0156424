I"ê<h1 id="using-images-on-web-pages">Using images on web pages</h1>

<p>Only use images if it adds value and purpose to your content. For example, images showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>different types of potholes to report a dangerous pothole</li>
  <li>different wedding venues for weddings</li>
  <li>a caravan‚Äôs internal layout for booking short breaks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-your-images-accessible">Make your images accessible</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre adding images to a web page, make sure they are accessible to everyone including those that use assistive technologies.</p>

<p>Alt text allows assistive technology to describe the image to people with visual impairments.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-text-alt-text">Alternative text (alt text)</h3>

<p>Before adding alt text, you need to decide if the image is decorative or informative.</p>

<h4 id="decorative-images">Decorative images</h4>

<p>Decorative images can be used for a news story or a social media post.</p>

<p>If the image is decorative and doesn‚Äôt add value to the content, you can help assistive technology users ignore it. You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>marking it as decorative in documents or other applications that include this as an option</li>
  <li>setting the alt text to null in the code (alt=‚Äù‚Äù)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="informative-images">Informative images</h4>

<p>Informative images must have alt text that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tells the user what information the image provides</li>
  <li>is meaningful, concise and no more than a sentence or two</li>
</ul>

<p>A good way to think about alt text is how would you describe the image to someone who was on the telephone.</p>

<p>Avoid:</p>
<ul>
  <li>using ‚Äòimage of‚Äô or ‚Äòphoto of‚Äô. A screen reader will already read this out</li>
  <li>repeating the surrounding text like the title of a news story or guidance it relates to</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of good descriptive alt text.
Insert image
Alt text: Doctor writing up notes in surgery</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of a bad alt text. 
Insert image
Alt text: Nominations open for the 2020 Essex Teaching Awards</p>

<!-- See [create accessible documents for more guidance](/docs/core/accessibility/creating-an-accessible-pdf). -->

<h3 id="text-on-images">Text on images</h3>

<p>Don‚Äôt include text on your images. This is not accessible for people using screen readers. Search engines also cannot read information in images.</p>

<p>If the text is an important part of the content, write it in the body content.</p>

<h2 id="gifs-and-animation">GIFs and animation</h2>

<p>GIFs and animation are distracting and people with seizure disabilities or sensitivity to motion may dislike moving or flashing images.</p>

<p>GIFs and animation should only be used if there‚Äôs a clear user need. They should contain no more than 3 flashes per second.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre using them to explain something, provide a text alternative, captions or transcripts in the body text.</p>

<h2 id="using-complex-images-or-diagrams">Using complex images or diagrams</h2>

<p>This includes flow diagrams or infographics.</p>

<p>Consider whether the information on diagrams or illustrations is better presented with text including headings and sub headings.</p>

<p>If these flow diagrams or illustrations help add more information and make things clearer, then include them and provide alternative text in the body content.</p>

<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add diagrams and illustrations as one image and not as separate components</li>
  <li>add alt text</li>
  <li>save them as .png files as this format is better for diagrams that include text and clear lines</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-charts-and-graphs">Using charts and graphs</h2>

<p>Complex images like charts and graphs can be difficult for some users, including those with low vision and learning disabilities to understand.</p>

<p>You need to include both a short and long description of the chart or graph.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/">W3C has a tutorial on making complex images accessible</a>.</p>

<h3 id="short-description">Short description</h3>

<p>This is a brief description of the image that you add to the alt text.</p>

<p>An example is: Bar graph showing council tax totals for 2019.</p>

<h3 id="long-description">Long description</h3>

<p>This is where you explain the content of the image in greater detail so a user who may not understand the visual image can have a full text alternative.</p>

<p>An example is:
The bar graphs shows how much is spent each day on the following services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adult social care, ¬£1,698,647</li>
  <li>Schools, ¬£1,250,376</li>
  <li>Children‚Äôs services ¬£360,496</li>
  <li>Early years and childcare, ¬£264,404</li>
  <li>Environment and waste, ¬£224,404</li>
  <li>Public health, ¬£175,131</li>
  <li>Infrastructure, ¬£174,819</li>
  <li>Library services, ¬£38,739</li>
  <li>Economic development, ¬£18,582</li>
  <li>Coroners services, ¬£9,198</li>
  <li>Country parks, ¬£8,917</li>
  <li>Registrar services, ¬£6,961</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="logos">Logos</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt use logos to brand web pages or acknowledge partners. Logos should only be used if there‚Äôs a clear user need. For example, using the Verify Visa logo for taking payments as this is seen as a trusted source.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/use-of-government-logos-on-gov-uk">GOV.UK has more guidance on using logos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buttons-and-icons">Buttons and icons</h2>

<p>These should only be used if there‚Äôs a clear user need and not for decorative purposes.</p>

<p>For example, see our <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/start/care-contribution-calculator">contribution calculator</a> which has a start button that serves a function.</p>

<h2 id="image-maps">Image maps</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt use geographical maps as images unless they are essential to the content.</p>

<p>You can use interactive maps like <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6396990?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">Google maps</a>  that allow someone to navigate them using a keyboard.</p>

<p>Provide a text alternative in in the body content for users who aren‚Äôt able to use the map. This could be the address and directions to get to the location. See our <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/visit-us">visit us</a>
page.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-on-webpages">Adding images on webpages</h2>

<p>Images should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in landscape format</li>
  <li>high resolution that can be resized appropriately</li>
  <li>less than 500KB per image</li>
  <li>saved as .jpeg files ‚Äì this format is better for photographs</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid using images with a white background. Use background colours to give good colour contrast.</p>

<h2 id="images-and-copyright">Images and copyright</h2>

<p>Only include images that you have permission to use.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre using images with copyright restrictions, make sure you give the appropriate credit to the owner.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre using photographs of people, make sure you have their consent before using them.</p>
