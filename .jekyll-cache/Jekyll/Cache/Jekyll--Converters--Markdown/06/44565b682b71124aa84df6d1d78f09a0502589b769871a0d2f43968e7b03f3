<h1 id="using-video-and-audio">Using video and audio</h1>

<p>All video and audio content we produce must be accessible. This means making sure that all users can access the same content, so they are not excluded.</p>

<p>Including captions or transcripts helps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>users with hearing and cognitive impairments understand the content easily</li>
  <li>users who may want to watch or listen to content in a noisy office or on public transport</li>
  <li>search engines like Google and Bing find your content, this means more people access and engage with it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="video-content">Video content</h2>

<p>When you produce video content, you need to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if the video has audio, add closed captions or the text transcript</li>
  <li>if the video doesn‚Äôt have audio (for example, it includes diagrams without a verbal description) then you need to include an audio description or a detailed transcript</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audio-content">Audio content</h2>

<p>Audio only content, for example a podcast or MP3 should be accompanied by a transcript.</p>

<h2 id="accessible-video-players">Accessible video players</h2>

<p>Make sure that the multimedia player is accessible for keyboard and screen reader users. They should be able to control the play/pause button and slider.</p>

<p><a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/">Able player</a> is a good example of an accessible multimedia player.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-transcript">Creating a transcript</h2>

<p>You can create your own video transcript using the YouTube video editor.</p>

<p>To find out how to do this, check out <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554">automatic captioning on YouTube help</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unable to do a transcript yourself, there are captioning and transcription services available, like <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/">3PlayMedia</a>, that can do this for you.</p>

<p>This is a paid service, so you will need to decide if it is something that you can budget for.</p>

<h2 id="using-video-and-audio-content-on-social-media">Using video and audio content on social media</h2>

<p>If you share your video or audio content on social media, the following platforms allow you to add captions or a transcript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter, use the <a href="https://media.twitter.com/en_us/articles/blogs/2019/subtitles-now-available-in-ios-and-android.html">Media Studio library</a> and follow the instructions</li>
  <li>Facebook, use the following guide on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/261764017354370">how to add captions on Facebook</a></li>
  <li>LinkedIn, use the following guide on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/93997/adding-closed-captioning-to-videos-on-linkedin?lang=en">adding closed captions to video on LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Instagram doesn‚Äôt have the facility to add captions on the platform. There are third-party tools and services that can provide this as a paid service.</p>
