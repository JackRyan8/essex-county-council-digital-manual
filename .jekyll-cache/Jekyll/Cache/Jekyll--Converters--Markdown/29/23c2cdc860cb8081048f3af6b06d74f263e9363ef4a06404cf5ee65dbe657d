<p>Before you do anything to change an existing service or create a new one you need to put some time into discovery and insight.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-existing-products-and-services">Understanding existing products and services</h2>

<p>Find out as much as you can about how successful the existing products or service is for users. Use the following to inform you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Analytics data</li>
  <li>Online feedback</li>
  <li>Phone call volumes and anecdotal insight from the advisors</li>
  <li><a href="/essex-county-council-digital-manual/Service-Transformation-team/User-need/User-testing">User testing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Analysing multiple sources of data means that you have a rounded view of behaviour. Itâ€™s only when you do this that you start to see the whole picture which may be lost by just looking at web stats.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> You can identify services which have high call volumes for general information queries which would suggest that we need to do some work to promote or improve our online services.</p>
