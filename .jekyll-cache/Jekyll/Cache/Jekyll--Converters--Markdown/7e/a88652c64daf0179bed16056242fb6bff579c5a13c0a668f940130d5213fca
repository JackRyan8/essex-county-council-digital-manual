<h2 id="why-its-important">Why itâ€™s important</h2>

<p>Most users find our content from Google or other search engines. Itâ€™s important that users can find our content so they can achieve their goal or task.</p>

<p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) ensures that search engines rank your content so users can find it.</p>

<h2 id="meet-the-user-needs">Meet the user needs</h2>

<p>Design content around user needs to ensure your content is useful and relevant.</p>

<p>See the <a href="user-need">user needs section</a> of this toolkit for more why user needs are important.</p>

<h2 id="keywords-in-content">Keywords in content</h2>

<p>Keywords are what people use on search engines.</p>

<p>Use the same terms and language that people use to search. This helps them find your content easily and quickly.</p>

<p>Use keywords in the URL, title, teaser text, meta description and body content.</p>

<h3 id="url">URL</h3>

<p>The URL is the web address of your page. It should be concise, descriptive and contain the keyword.</p>

<p>Use hyphens to separate the words so search engines understands the words clearly. Donâ€™t use underscores.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example: <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge/who-can-get-a-blue-badge">https://www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge/who-can-get-a-blue-badge</a></p>

<p>See our <a href="url-guidelines">URL guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="titles-teaser-text-and-meta-description">Titles, teaser text and meta description</h3>

<p>Put the main keyword in the page title. This is the most important on-page SEO.</p>

<p>The page title is Heading 1. Itâ€™s one of the first things a user sees in a search engineâ€™s results page. Itâ€™s important to use a good descriptive title that includes the main keyword.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of a title, teaser text and meta description:</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> 
Accessible transport and mobility</p>

<p><strong>Teaser text:</strong>
Blue Badge, disabled parking bays, mobility aids and accessible transport</p>

<p><strong>Meta description:</strong> 
Transport, travel and mobility for people with a disability. Includes Blue Badge, accessible transport, disabled parking bays and mobility aids.</p>

<h3 id="body-content">Body content</h3>

<p>Include the main keywords in the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>first 100 words of your body content</li>
  <li>alternative text for images and file names</li>
</ul>

<p>Use other keywords related to your content. Search engines check for words that should appear alongside a search term or keyword. For example, blue badge and disabled badge, parking permit or parking badge.</p>

<p>Use headings and subheadings. They help search engines understand what youâ€™re writing about.</p>

<p>Apply heading styles correctly. Use subheadings to structure your content. Use them in order, for example Heading 2 is after Heading 1, Heading 2 is followed by Heading 3.</p>

<p>See <a href="creating-an-accessible-pdf">creating accessible document</a> for guidance on applying heading styles.</p>

<h2 id="find-out-what-users-are-searching-for">Find out what users are searching for</h2>

<p>Use Google Analytics to help you find out what your users are searching for when looking for your content including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>external search terms that led users to a page from Google or other search engines</li>
  <li>internal search terms that users used while on Essex.gov.uk or other sites</li>
</ul>
