<h1 id="what-to-do-with-faqs">What to do with FAQs</h1>

<p>Frequently asked questions (FAQs) don’t make good web content. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk">Government Digital Service (GDS) discourages them</a>.</p>

<p>If the information is unique, you can help people read it by structuring it and taking it out of the questions and answers format.</p>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>Headings are important because they jump out at the user and when written well can help navigate quickly.</p>

<p>Use statement for your headings, rather than questions. You can front load the headings with the keywords.</p>

<p>For example, instead of ‘How do I apply for a school place?’, say ‘Apply for a school place’.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Create a logical structure, grouping information about the same topic together, using headings and sub-headings.</p>

<p>Start with the most important point or action. You don’t need to write a lot of background information.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-repetition">Avoid repetition</h2>

<p>Several questions may have the same answer. You should group these together using a single heading.</p>

<h2 id="keep-things-short">Keep things short</h2>

<p>Write in short sentences and short paragraphs, broken up with bullet points wherever you are listing several items.</p>
