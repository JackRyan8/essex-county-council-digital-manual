## Why data is important 

Collecting data about your service allows you to measure its performance. 

Data can show you if: 

- the service is meeting user needs
- the service allows users to easily complete the task it provides
- there are enough people using the service to make it cost-efficient
- people know about the service and are choosing to use it 

## Setting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

KPIs are a way of measuring performance. Having clear objectives and the right metrics will tell you if the service is solving the problem it’s meant to. 

Think about: 

- the objectives of your service 
- individual goals for each objective 
- your KPIs for each goal 
- the targets for your KPIs  

## Web measurement framework 

This is an example of a web measurement framework we use at Essex County Council (ECC) for measuring performance.  

It forms the basis of reports and dashboards and will change slightly from service to service. 

### Objective 1: provide engaging content  

<div class="table">
<table>
  <caption>The goal is to increase content engagement.</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">KPIs</th>
        <th scope="col">KPI target</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Scroll depth</td>
        <td>50%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Average on time page</td>
        <td>2.54 minutes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of feedback comments</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pages per session</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Objective 2: provide effective content

<div class="table">
<table>
  <caption>The goal is to increase content effectiveness.</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">KPIs</th>
        <th scope="col">KPI target</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of clicked on external links</td>
        <td>205</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of document downloads </td>
        <td>110</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of widget completions</td>
        <td>10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of completed assessment forms</td>
        <td>7</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of video views</td>
        <td>36</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bounce rate</td>
        <td>40%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of internal search</td>
        <td>120</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Objective 3: knowledge base

<div class="table">
<table>
  <caption>The goal is to increase website traffic.</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">KPIs</th>
        <th scope="col">KPI target</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Total number of monthly visits</td>
        <td>15,000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of visits for each acquisition channel</td>
        <td>Segmented</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Total number of visits carrying out a goal or event</td>
        <td>Segmented</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Number of returning visits compared to new visits </td>
        <td>Segmented</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## How to use data  

When you’ve collected data about your service, it’s important to use it to help you make improvements. 

This includes: 

- [measuring and reviewing content](/essex-county-council-digital-manual/Content-standards/Content-guidelines/Measuring-and-reviewing-content) to make sure it’s meeting user needs
- working with a user researcher to understand why people are behaving in certain ways
- reviewing call centre data to identify common queries
- reviewing financial information, for example, how much your service costing, to make sure it’s value for money
