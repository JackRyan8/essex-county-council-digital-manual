# {{ page.title }}

## Mission Statement

We are committed to improving outcomes for people in Essex and helping meet the strategic aims of the Council. 

We want to deliver modern public services based on a deep understanding of the needs of people who use them and we will challenge existing ways of thinking and doing. 

## Who we are

We are a team of business and digital design professionals who together offer a range of complementary skills and approaches to solving problems and modernising public services. 

## What we do

We work with teams across the council to develop new skills and find better ways to improve outcomes and value for money for people in Essex.  

## How we work together

Service Transformation is a team sport!  We work in multi-disciplinary teams to understand a problem.  

We design, build and iterate a solution or service based on our understanding of the needs of people who use it. 

We work in short sprints so we can focus on the things that will add most value. 

We move forward when we know enough rather than when we have all the answers. 

We invite feedback from others and test our ideas early to ensure we are moving in the right direction. 

## Roles

The types of skills needed will change depending on the phase of a project or the lifecycle of a service but will likely include.  

- **User Researchers** focus on understanding user behaviours, needs and motivations and represents the voice of the user in design decisions. 

- **Service Designers** focus on users and their goals and how they interact with the organisation, to improve the user experience and make services better, faster and cheaper for everyone. 

- **Product Managers** focus on the digital touchpoints for users that enable them to interact with a service and manage the lifecycle of digital products. 

- **Organisation Designers** focus on the design of structures and teams, creating alignment or fit between the strategy of the organisation and the work that it delivers.  

- **Content Designers** create easily understandable and findable information that serves an identified user need in the most appropriate format.  It is not just about writing text​. 

- **Business Designers** focus on identifying and recognising business needs and finding solutions to various business problems.  

- **Continuous Improvement** practitioners focus on identifying and implementing measurable improvements based on small changes that are typically inexpensive to implement and drive value and efficiencies.
